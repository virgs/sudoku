Yet another game-oriented-fun-and-studying-project

## Overview

This project is dedicated to the art of Sudoku puzzles, their abstractions, and their variations.
*Sudoku killer* was for a long time the puzzle I had fun with before bed. To be honest, I was never attracted to code it, simply because it didn't seem challenging enough.

However, things changed when I added some artificial constraints:

1. **Sudoku Variations**: Immerse yourself in the fascinating world of Sudoku, exploring different abstractions and variations (mini, classic, killer, and puzzle).
2. **React Project**: improve my React skills and increase my HTML/CSS proficiency. No game engine at all. The code abstraction must be good enough to handle any type of dimension and variation of the Sudoku grid.
3. **Have fun**: Most of the games I've coded recently were practically forgotten as soon as their last commit was pushed. I needed one that not only could I play later, but I wanted to. Some record stats would be nice too.

I got really satisfied with the results. [Check it yourself](https://virgs.github.io/sudoku).
